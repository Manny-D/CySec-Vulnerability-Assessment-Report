<h1>Vulnerability Assessment Report </br>
July 10, 2023</h1>

<h2>Scenario</h2>
In this project, I am a newly hired cybersecurity analyst for an e-commerce company. The company stores information on a remote database server, since many of the employees work remotely from locations all around the world. Employees of the company regularly query, or request, data from the server to find potential customers. The database has been open to the public since the company's launch three years ago. Keeping the database server open to the public is a serious vulnerability.
</br>
</br>
A vulnerability assessment of the situation will help communicate the potential risks with decision makers at the company. I will create a written report that clearly explains how the vulnerable server is a risk to business operations and how it can be secured.
</br>
</br>

<h2>System Description</h2>
The server hardware consists of a powerful CPU processor and 128GB of memory. It runs on the latest version of Linux operating system and hosts a MySQL database management system. It is configured with a stable network connection using IPv4 addresses and interacts with other servers on the network. Security measures include SSL/TLS encrypted connections.
</br></br>

<h2>Scope</h2>
The scope of this vulnerability assessment relates to the current access controls of the system. The assessment will cover a period of three months, from June 2023 to August 2023. NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1 is used to guide the risk analysis of the information system.
</br>
</br>

<h2>Purpose</h2>
<h3>Relevent questions:</h3>

- How is the database server valuable to the business?
- The DB server contains data for/of the orgâ€™s potential customers. 
- Why is it important for the business to secure the data on the server?
- It is important as this is our customer base which also contains their PII which needs to be protected. 
- How might the server impact the business if it were disabled?
- Our employees would no longer be able to query data essential to business thereby placing progress at a halt.

<h2>Risk Assessment</h2>

| Threat source | Threat event                                  | Likelihood | Severity | Risk |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------------|------------|----------|------|
| Competitor    | Obtain sensitive information via exfiltration | 1          | 3        | 3    |
| Power         | Power going out -> add UPS                    | 3          | 3        | 9    |
| Employee      | Disgruntled -> change / delete info           | 1          | 3        | 3    |

</br>

<h2>Approach</h2>
The above 3 were chosen to address the likelihood of the threat(s) occurring and their effects on the organization. 
</br>
The Competitor and Employee threats carry the same Risk score of 3.  
</br>
They present the issues of: 

- the competitor obtaining data about our customers affecting Confidentiality; and 
- a disgruntled employee changing data affecting the Integrity of our data. 
</br>
Finally, the server may be affected by a power outage affecting it's accessibility or Availability. 
</br>
</br>

<h2>Remediation Strategy</h2>
Encryption of data in motion using TLS instead of SSL. IP allow-listing to corporate offices to prevent random users from the internet from connecting to the database.
</br>
</br>
Adding UPS to server room in case of an area power outage. 
</br>
</br>
Implement authentication, authorization, and auditing mechanisms to ensure that only authorized users access the database server includes the use of strong passwords, role-based access controls, and multi-factor authentication to limit user privileges.
